<p>Faark it's hot, but it's always been hot in summer right… everyone remembers burning bitumen under foot, restless hot nights,
  has anything really changed?</p>

<p>The answer is YES! It's getting hotter, if you don't think it's happening read this piece, and this piece, and this piece…
  and this piece. And if you've read all of them and you're still not convinced here a list of things that are less certain
  than climate change that you're probably not willing to take a risk on.</p>

<p>But before we go too far lets go back to those hot summer nights of your childhood… when were you born? (don't worry we don't
  record this information).</p>

<p class="eighties">Ahh the 80's crazy hair, Michael J Fox, lax government messaging around drinking (Hawkey sculling a beer).... And trendsetters</p>


<p class="seventies">So you're a child of the 70s, just like the term global warming, which had its first official mention in a paper by Wally
  Broecker in the August 1975 issue of Science.</p>

<p>Summers were really hot then, no aircon, vinyl seats… well not exactly.</p>


<p class="boomers">So you've seen a few summers in your time then, and I'm sure you remember some pretty damn hot ones from your childhood too?
</p>

<p>The year you first emerged screaming into the world - the global temperature was <span class="mean-year">XX</span> degrees <span class="above-below">above</span> average. </p>

<p class="eighties">And it's been above average every year since then.</p>


<p class="seventies">But the seventies would see the beginning of the climb in temperatures.</p>


<p class="boomers">Your entire childhood the temperature didn't go above the global average.</p>

<p>Spare a thought for a kid who is five now - their last three summers have all been the hottest on record - their coolest
  summer (the year they were born) is still the 10th hottest summer of all time.</p>
  
<p>You had to wait til you were <span class="minus-birth-year-2010">2010 minus year of birth</span> to experience the temperature increases that are normal for them.</p>
